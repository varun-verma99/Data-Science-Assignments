    "Ans - To install python on windows:-\n",
    "    1.To download Python, you need to visit www.python.org, which is the official Python website.\n",
    "    2.Click on the Downloads tab and then select the Windows option. \n",
    "    3.This will take you to the page where the different Python releases for Windows can be found. Since I am using a 64bit system, I’ll select “Windows x86-64 executable installer”.\n",
    "    4.Once the executable file download is complete, you can open it to install Python.\n",
    "    5.Click on Run, which will start the installation process.\n",
    "    6.Once the installation is complete, the below pop-up box will appear: Setup was successful.\n",
    "    - To Set Path Variables:-\n",
    "    1.First, we must find the directory where we installed Python. A typical installation would have the following path, C:\\Users\\MyUserName\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\n",
    "    2.Now, we will need to add this to the PATH variable, we right click on \"This PC\" and go to \"Properties\".\n",
    "    3.Then, we click on the \"Advanced system settings\" in the menu on the left.going\n",
    "    4.In the bottom right, we can see a button labeled \"Environment Variables\". We will click on it to open another window to edit these variables.\n",
    "    5.Now, we select the \"Path variable\" in the \"System variables\" section and click \"Edit\". The next screen will show all the directories currently part of the PATH variable.\n",
    "    6.Another window opens up where we can see all the paths for the currently configured system variables. To add a new path for our Python program, we will click on the \"New\" button on the right side and paste the path in Step 1\n",
    "    7.We have successfully added the path for our Python program to our system's environment variables. The best practice is to restart the system afterward for the change to occur.\n",
    "    8.Now, we can verify if the PATH variable was configured correctly by opening up the terminal and entering the command python --version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16. \n",
    "Ans - Indentation is a very important concept of Python because without properly indenting the Python code, you will end up seeing Indentation Error and the code will not get compiled."
